A small dataset I collected from various cam manufacturers websites, 
detailing some technical specifications of cams.

A short html report describing this dataset can be viewed 
[here](https://rawgit.com/Armadilloa16/cam_report/master/report.html).

This report was written in [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). 
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
[knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) and [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) converted 
the raw Rmarkdown to html.
